I focused on the period this font was created and the architectural components of the time. During the renaissance, domes and arches were seen frequently. I used letterforms and symbols to emulate the arches found on buildings. I also added supplementary textures and motifs to further my design."></a></li>

                    <li id="poster-photo-2" class="carousel__slide"><a href="img/swingposter.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery4" data-caption="This poster is inspired by Wynton Marsalis's Swing Symphony album. The album is composed of seven songs that work together to explain jazz history. I wanted this poster to represent jazz and its evolution. I included colors that match the tone of the jazz age, as well I edited a typeface to represent each letter as the building block to where we are now in the jazz world."></a></li>

                    <li id="poster-photo-3" class="carousel__slide"><a href="img/daposter.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery4" data-caption="This poster is inspired by David Adjaye. The idea around this design was to pull from the geometric forms that David Adjaye creates within his architectural buildings. He has a very simplistic design to his buildings that bring in a lot of light. So I incorporate the idea of light with depth. As well, I chose to use simple shapes with repetition to create a unique composition that still reflected Davidâ€™s style."></a></li>

                    Another way to create a lasting impression on a client or target audience is through poster design. They say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and I would say the same goes for well-designed posters. The ability to catch a person's attention in a matter of seconds, all while providing them with all of the information needed, is ever rewarding.
