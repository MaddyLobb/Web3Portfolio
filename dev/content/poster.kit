                    This poster is inspired by the font Bembo, created by Francesco Griffo in 1495. I focused on the period this font was created and the architectural components of the time. During the renaissance, domes and arches were seen frequently. I used letterforms and symbols to emulate the arches found on buildings. I also added supplementary textures and motifs to further my design.
