        <h4>My passion lies with design and its social impact. Design involves problem-solving and a specific way of thinking to be able to perform certain needs for any business or industry. Design has the power to 
            transform an industry a company and a community and Iâ€™m eager to be a part of that change. 
            
            Through design, I have formed skills of collaboration in the classroom and the workplace. Collaboration is a building block of design and without it boundaries would not be pushed and creativity would not flourish. Presenting designs is another form of communication to ensure 
            that 
            my vision is understood. This portfolio reveals my commitment to the research process and production to produce my vision for each design.
            
            When I am not in the studio, I am reading a book, I am on a hike, or working on my photography skills. </h4>
