                Photography has been a part of my life since I was little. Originally photography was something I experienced rather than did myself. Since 2015, I have been taking pictures and furthering my skills.

                My photography style revolves around abstracted shapes, concepts, and light interaction. Other forms of photography I participate in include product photography, landscape photography, and family or couples photography.
