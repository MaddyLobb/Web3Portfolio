            This poster is inspired by the font Bembo, created by Francesco Griffo in 1495. I focused on the period this font was created and the architectural components of the time. During the renaissance, domes and arches were seen frequently. I used letterforms and symbols to emulate the arches found on buildings. I also added supplementary textures and motifs to further my design.

            This publication design is based on Inspire, a magazine about achieving luxury interior design for everyone. This publication is a large format with a quarterly subscription. It has a strict three-column grid with the top third of the magazine dedicated to image space and or textures. The masthead has the ability to move locations and interact with the cover, and the masthead applications can be seen within the magazine.
