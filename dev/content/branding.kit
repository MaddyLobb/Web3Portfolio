            This brand redesign is based on Saint Jude‘s Children’s Research Hospital. A hospital that provides lifesaving cures to children with cancer. With this assignment, I was able to create a brand identity that fulfilled a child's need for play, and a parent's need for trust. I created a new logo, stationary standards, social media standards, and a website design all based on their previous concepts and current mission statement.
