            <h4>My passion lies with design and its social impact. Design involves problem-solving and a specific way of thinking to be able to perform certain needs for any business or industry. Design has the power to 
                transform an industry a company and a community and I’m eager to be a part of that change. 
                
                Through design, I have formed skills of collaboration in the classroom and the workplace. Collaboration is a building block of design and without it boundaries would not be pushed and creativity would not flourish. Presenting designs is another form of communication to ensure 
                that 
                my vision is understood. This portfolio reveals my commitment to the research process and production to produce my vision for each design.

            <h4>Photography has been a part of my life since I was little. Originally photography
                was something I experienced rather than did myself. Since 2015, I have been taking pictures and furthering my skills. 
                
                My photography style revolves around abstracted shapes, concepts, and light interaction. Other forms of photography I participate in include product photography, landscape photography, and family or couples photography.

                This poster is inspired by the font Bembo, created by Francesco Griffo in 1495. I focused on the period this font was created and the architectural components of the time. During the renaissance, domes and arches were seen frequently. I used letterforms and symbols to emulate the arches found on buildings. I also added supplementary textures and motifs to further my design.

                This brand redesign is based on Saint Jude‘s Children’s Research Hospital. A hospital that provides lifesaving cures to children with cancer. With this assignment, I was able to create a brand identity that fulfilled a child's need for play, and a parent's need for trust. I created a new logo, stationary standards, social media standards, and a website design all based on their previous concepts and current mission statement.

                This publication design is based on Inspire, a magazine about achieving luxury interior design for everyone. This publication is a large format with a quarterly subscription. It has a strict three-column grid with the top third of the magazine dedicated to image space and or textures. The masthead has the ability to move locations and interact with the cover, and the masthead applications can be seen within the magazine.
